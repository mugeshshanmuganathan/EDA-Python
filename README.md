# EDA-Python
Performed hands-on exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an e-commerce dataset using Python. Uncovered trends in sales, profit, shipping, and customer behavior using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Built visual reports for business insights.
# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects with Python

This repository contains hands-on exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed using Python on two different real-world datasets:

1. 🛒 **Commodity Price Dataset**
2. 🏥 **Insurance Customer Dataset**

Both projects were carried out using core Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`, focusing on uncovering patterns, outliers, distributions, and key insights useful for data-driven decision-making.

## 🧠 Key Objectives

### Commodity Price EDA:
- Trend analysis of commodity prices over time
- Price comparison across markets
- Outlier detection and seasonal patterns
- Visualization of price volatility

### Insurance Dataset EDA:
